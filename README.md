# What makes a good TED talk ?

How many times have we heard someone give a talk, and walked away asking ourselves, "What was he or she even talking about?". This is the cardinal sin of speeches. Even if the audience hasn't had to pay money to attend a talk, they're giving something potentially more valuable: their time. Hence it is imperative for the speaker to not only have a proper structure to but also have a good storytelling approach. Ted speakers are very good at giving such talks.
This project focuses on deducing the elemental reason why TED talks are considered the benchmark for influential speeches.
